# Traffic Management using Quality Methodologies

The project focusses on solving the problem of `Traffic Delays` due to `Traffic Congestion`. The country taken into account for the study purposes is `India`.

## Objective

Main objectives are to identify the Critical to Quality parameters, which contribute to the overall quality of traffic on roads, to measure and improve the identified CTQs using six sigma techniques, and to ensure that the problems identified are solved after successful implementation of the DMAIC approach.

### Concepts/ Methodologies used

1. DMAIC (Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)
2. DPMO (Defects per Million Opportunities)
3. R&R (Repeatability & Reproducibility) Analysis
4. SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, Customers) Diagrams
5. P-charts
6. Pareto Chart
7. Cause and Effect Diagram
8. Root Cause Analysis
9. PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle
10. Affinity Diagram
